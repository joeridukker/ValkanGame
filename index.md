## In Brief

In Valkan you will have to fight your way to victory! Play one of the pre-build maps alone or with friends and slay various monsters and bosses in dungeons and areans. For example there spiders and minotaurs which will hunt their pray using a path finding algorithm. For the creative minds out there, it is also possible to create and save your own levels with a build-in level editor! It features an auto tilling algorithm and simple mouse click events to place and remove objects. And after working hard on your map feel free to play the map with your friends.

### Goal
Ofcourse the main goal is to have fun, but ofcourse also to win. You can do this by killing every single monster in the current level. At the end there will be a boss that has to be defeated. Killing monsters is just as easy as picking one of the classes like wizard and spam your unique abilities to, for example, shoot fireballs!
